## Introduction :
During a period of uncertainty, valuable assets were being overlooked, and even the landlord himself sold the property with a discount compared to its price five years earlier. This was due to negative market sentiment driven by fear of further decline or a crash. However, as Warren Buffett suggests, such times of fear often present the greatest opportunities.

## Objective : 
US Residential Real Estate Data offers valuable insights for buyers looking to make investment-based decisions. Key metrics like Average Property Value and Average Property Value per Square-Foot provide a comprehensive view of property values across different types, aiding in assessing relative value.

## In Summary :
Based on observations, Townhouse and Condominium shows stable values, as the valuation per square foot tends to remain constant across different percentiles. This reflects a "Consistent Market Appeal". On the other hand, for Single Family Dwelling (SFD) and Commercial shows an increasing variability as percentiles rise. This suggests that the higher variability in valuation per square foot at higher percentiles may be influenced by sensitivity to external factors such as location, property type, or surrounding facilities. 

In short, business implications > Townhouse and Condominium are positive considerations for investors or buyers seeking stability in property values over a specific period.
